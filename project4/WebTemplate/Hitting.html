	<p> Unleashed Hitting is the perfect place to come and train your baseball/softball
		skills in a controlled environment. All instructors have achieved a high pedigree
		through personal playing or coaching experiences. Learn the proper mechanics to
		hit for contact, hit for power, situational hitting, bunting, chopping, slapping,
		power-slap, soft-slap, and 2-strike approach. Learn how to understand the difference
		between baseball hitting philosophies and softball philosophies. Unleashed hitting teaches
		linear swings to softball players; while allowing baseball players to chose between linear and
		rotational swings.</p>
