      <h3>Good Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>Good heading hierarchy consists of using bigger sized fonts for the different layers of the webpage. A page title should always be greater than its category, which will be greater than the subcategory and so forth. This helps direct the viewers around the page and shows importance of information. This can be done using the h1-h6 heading tags for html. The following menu displays a great example of proper heading hierarchy:</p>

      <h1>East Moon Steakhouse</h1>
      <h2>Hibachi.............</h2>
      <h3>Chicken............... 16.99</h3>
      <p>A generous portion of chicken served with 2 complimentary shrimp per person, hibachi fried rice, Japanese clear soup, and a small salad.</p>
